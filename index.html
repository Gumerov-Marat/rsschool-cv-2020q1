      My goal is to become a professional in web development. To start, I want to become a front end developer, and then
      for
      the back end. I previously studied a different language (Java), but I always liked websites more. I studied
      various free
      courses on the web, but now I have more practice. Recently, I have been studying the language of Javascript and I
      really
      like it.
